# Lasso-ElasticNet-toolkit

These codes were used in my PhD projects for Extracting low Signal in High Dimensional Data Sets https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/48628/. It includes Greedy Algorithms such as CoSaMP and OMP.
The Lasso and Elastic package contain the detailed analysis of high dimensional inference using these two most popular regression tools.
