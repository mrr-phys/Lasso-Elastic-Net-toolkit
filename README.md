# Lasso-ElasticNet-toolkit

These codes were used in my PhD projects for Extracting Sparse Signal from High Dimensional (p << n) DataSets https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/48628/. It includes Greedy Algorithms such as CoSaMP and OMP.
The Lasso and Elastic folders contain the detailed analysis of high dimensional inference using these two most popular regression tools using CVXOPT http://cvxopt.org/.
